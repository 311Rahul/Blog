			    “Hold on, Jon—you’re saying that caring TOO MUCH about sex can stop me from getting laid? Isn’t your notch count in the triple digits, though?”

Yes, and yes. I know it may seem contradictory, but bear with me for a second…it will all make sense very soon. See, while most men only care about sex, women are a little bit different.

Men are primarily attracted to visual cues—in other words, a woman’s appearance turns us on. Obviously there’s other factors that come into play, like her feminine energy, her personality, and everything else, but men care a lot about how a girl looks.

Women, on the other hand, care more about a man’s IMAGE…big difference. They care about WHO he is, more so than WHAT he looks like. They care about the connection that they have with a man. They care about whether or not they feel safe with him.

They want to know if he’s confident or not, they want to know what his fears are…they want to know WHO HE IS. So if you only ever try to have sex with a woman, without engaging in any sort of meaningful conversation, you probably won’t get laid as much as you like.

Sure, you’ll get laid a good amount. Hell, when I first started learning game I only showed women my sexual side. I didn’t talk much, I wasn’t very vulnerable, and I was extremely sexually assertive…and it worked, to an extent.

But I’ve found that balancing BOTH my desire to have sex, AND my desire to express myself and figure out whether or not she’s a woman I’m interested in emotionally has yielded much better results. I could write an entire post on this, and maybe I will, but for now, take the tip for what it is.

#2 – You Don’t Approach Enough Women

Back in the early 2000’s when the PUA community first emerged, guys used to have this thing called the “batting average.” It was basically the ratio of women you talked to vs. women you ended up having sex with.

…and it was one of the dumbest fucking things I’ve ever seen in my entire life. Why? Well, for many reasons, but primarily because it ignores one fundamental principle of game.

Getting laid is a numbers game, plain and simple. You will have to approach literally thousands of women before you start to get good at this.

So by hiding behind a “batting average,” guys were able to mask their fear. “Haha, losers, my batting average is 1.0! I’ve never struck out!” some guy would say. But what this doesn’t reveal, is that he only ever had sex with one girl in his entire life.

I don’t know about you, but I’d rather have a batting average of .001, but sleep with 1 new girl a week. Who cares how many girls you have to talk to? Not every girl is going to be interested in you, and you shouldn’t WANT them all to be interested in you.

Some girls are vain, some are shallow, some are just plain stupid. You want to find the ‘cream of the crop,’ and you do this by talking to TONS of women, until you find the ones that you have chemistry with.

When you go out and practice your game, you should be rapid-fire approaching women. Talk to the first girl you see. Doesn’t work out? Cool, move to the next one. She hates you? Cool, move to the next one. Do this until you find one that you like.

This is how you overcome approach anxiety, it’s how you sharpen your social skills, and it’s how you get laid.
